Similar to the Lightning Network, Plasma is a series of contracts which runs on top of an existing blockchain to ensure enforcement while ensuring that one is able to hold funds in a contract state with net settlement/withdrawal at a later date





Plasma is composed of five key components

1. An **incentive layer** for persistently computing contracts in an economically efficient manner
2. **Structure for arranging child chains** in a tree format to maximize low-cost efficiency and net-settlement of transactions
3. **MapReduce** computing framework for constructing fraud proofs of state transitions within these nested chains to be compatible with the tree structure while reframing the state transitions to be highly scalable
4. **Consensus** mechanism which is dependent upon the root blockchain which attempts to replicate the results of the Nakamoto consensus incentives
5. **bitmap-UTXO commitment structure** for ensuring accurate state transitions off the root blockchain while minimizing mass-exit costs.
